### 1.2 Purpose
Specify the purpose of this SRS and its intended audience. This section should clarify the goals and objectives of the software to be developed.

### 1.3 Document Conventions
Describe any standards or conventions used throughout this document. For example, specify the notation, formatting, or terminology used.

### 1.4 Project Scope
Briefly define the scope of the software, including what the software will do and the key benefits it will provide to its users.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
Explain how the software fits within a larger system or context, if applicable. This may include a system interface diagram or descriptions of interactions with other systems.

### 2.2 Product Functions
Users will be able to log into our system using an account made for them by the company. They will be able to request different kinds of leave and absence types, which
will be approved or rejected by their managers. The system will allow for the outlining of a generic company hierarchy,
with office management creating the different projects, and managers managing the different teams within these projects.
Project managers manage the requests of their respective team members. Office managers manage the project managers.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
Describe the different types of users who will interact with the software and their respective characteristics.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
Define the environment under which the software will operate, including hardware, operating systems, and other required software.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
Specify constraints on the system's design and implementation, such as system requirements, programming languages, tools, and standards compliance.

### 2.6 User Documentation
Outline the scope and types of user documentation that will be provided.

### 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies
List any assumptions and dependencies that could affect the software requirements.

## 3. System Features

### 3.1 Feature Descriptions
Provide a detailed description of each system feature. This section is crucial for understanding the functionalities provided by the software.

### 3.2 Functional Requirements
List the detailed requirements necessary to provide the functionality described. These should be precise enough to guide development.

## 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 User Interfaces
Describe the layout and styles of the user interfaces. Include diagrams or mock-ups if possible.

### 4.2 Hardware Interfaces
